Week 1 

Group formed. I created the group on WebCMS and volunteered as the Scrum Master. As a group, we discussed which projects we were interested in pursuing. After doing an intial spike into the 3 projects we were most interested in, we decided on the Stock Portfolio project and began discussing APIs, libraries and tools that we could use. We also brainstormed some novel features we could implement, such as a predictive model and social features, and the difficulty of these.

Week 2

I setup a Google Docs page to collaborate our ideas for the Project Proposal, laying out major criteria we needed to achieve to plan the project. The team roughly scoped out the features we desired in the final product, and I ran a meeting on Monday evening to vet the features we wanted to propose. During this meeting we refined the exact features and objectives we wanted. I also proposed dividing the responsibility of the different sections of the proposal but an agreement was made to collaborate iteratively on all the parts. Collaborating with Junji, we broke down the major features into an extensive list of epics and user stories of which the rest of the team reviewed.
I refined the stories and epics further and added them to Jira, and also helped to roadmap the work for future sprints.

Week 3

Added descriptions to epics and explanation of the scope of each epic in the proposal. Reviewed other parts of the proposal and added comments and change suggestions. Developed UI wireframes with the team for Watchlists and Screeners.
Formatted and polished the final proposal and submitted it on Sunday evening.

Week 4

Set up frontend with Karim. Started working on Login/Signup screens and Header bar.
