## Background

Career Fairs Connect is a web platform that allows universities to create an interactive online careers fair that connects employers who are advertising their graduate and internship roles with students. 

### Goals

* Provide a platform where universities can organize a virtual careers fair space for employers and students.
* Allow employers to provide information about themselves and list their available graduate and internship roles for students to apply.
* Allow employers to schedule and host live event presentations.
* Connect students with employers via Q&A functionality.
* Allow students to maintain profiles with contactable details, work experience, project experience, academic achievements and technical competencies.

## [Live Demo](https://career-fairs-connect.netlify.app/landing)

The Frontend was built ontop of React with create-react-app and Redux Toolkit. A [happy path](https://github.com/sseanik/Career-Fairs-Connect/blob/main/HAPPY_PATH.md) set of steps is provided to help explore the entire functionality of the application.

## Credit

This application was collaborated in a CS9323 course with myself, [Max](https://github.com/Youps22), [Wanchen](https://github.com/WanchenZhao), [Arthur](https://github.com/af-af), [Thornton](https://github.com/ThorntonChan) and [Yulia](https://github.com/YuliaRodionov). Our tech stack primarily consists of React for frontend and Django for backend. I primarily contributed towards the Frontend component of this application, focusing on library integration (data tables, calendars, dynamic colourisation), design and responsiveness.
