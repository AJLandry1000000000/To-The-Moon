## Credit

This application was collaborated in a CS3900 course with myself, [Austin](https://github.com/AJLandry1000000000), [Karim](https://github.com/karim-saad), [Sarah](https://github.com/serahtan) and [Junji](https://github.com/pul-s4r). Our tech stack primarily consists of React for the frontend, Flask for the backend and PostgreSQL for the database. I primarily contributed towards the backend and data layers of this application, focusing on swagger documentation, database management and news related endpoints.
